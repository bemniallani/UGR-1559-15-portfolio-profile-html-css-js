#  UGR-1559-15-portfolio-profile-html-css-js

I appreciated for the second chance.
I did not submit the assignment of the html before but i uploaded it in github due the deadline,at first i was having problem with uploading a huge video file and then i ignored the video and it rejected me too.

But i was wondering what ‘1mark each minute delay means’. Is the penalty for the previous upload or it applies to a new one.(it’s whether i should upload it again or send the video ignored file).

###and with this confusion this is the right format and with my video included but being zipped.###

and i did make the first file i uploaded is on  UGR-1559-15-portfolio-profile-html-css-js-- reprository name (https://github.com/bemniallani/UGR-1559-15-portfolio-profile-html-css-js--) so grade me based on the uploaded time here. i did clone this file so dont see the html uploaded time of this file.

Thanking you in advance,
