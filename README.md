topic: The css file isnt being deployed

her mr. ,
was having an issue when i deployed my site. it doesnt include my css file but as you can see i already did that and the path are all fine. 
i havent been in this trouble before last time the html assignment was a trouble for me too uploading a big file( actually thank u for the second chance). 
but for this at least see my css file and i have also attached a screen record of how it works in vs code.
thanking you,
